## Philosphy
> Built for quick, clean and efficient needs

I wanted to build Classy-belt to make a simpler way of accessing everyday tasks and functions for a variety of work. Classy-belt is built on Nodejs and easily fits in with any project your working on. The kit has many "missing link" pieces of code for you to use and build off of.
